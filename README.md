# Restaurant-Cuisine-Classification
Developed a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisines as part of my internship at @Cognifyz Technologies. This project involved data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation. Excited to apply my learnings in real-world applications! ðŸš€
