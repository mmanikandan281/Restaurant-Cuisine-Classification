# Restaurant Cuisine Classification

## Overview
This project is part of my internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**. The objective is to develop a **machine learning model** to classify restaurants based on their cuisines using **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset contains restaurant details, including:
- Restaurant Name
- Cuisines
- City
- Locality

The primary goal is to classify restaurants into different cuisine categories based on the provided textual data.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Extracting primary cuisine type
- Encoding categorical variables

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Combining restaurant-related text data
- Applying **TF-IDF vectorization** for text representation

### 3. Model Training & Evaluation
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- Evaluation metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**

### 4. Model Interpretation & Improvements
- Analyzing feature importance
- Handling class imbalance with **SMOTE**
- Comparing different model performances

## Results
Both Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers were trained and evaluated. The results show promising accuracy in predicting the correct cuisine type based on restaurant data.
